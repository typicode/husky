> Git hooks made easy

Husky improves your commits and more üê∂*woof!*

You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports [all](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) Git hooks. 

## Features

- Zero dependencies
- Lightweight
- Fast
- Supports macOS, Linux and Windows

## Usage

### Install

_If you're already using husky in your project, see [#migrate](#migrate) for automatic migration._

```shell
npm install husky@next --save-dev

# Add pinst if you're publishing your project on a registry
npm install pinst --save-dev
```

Enable Git hooks

```
npx husky install
```

To automatically have Git hooks enabled after `npm install`, edit `package.json`

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "husky install"
  }
}
```

**important** if your package is not private and you're publishing it on a registry like [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com), you need to disable `postinstall` script using [pinst](https://github.com/typicode/pinst).

Otherwise, `postinstall` will run when someone installs your package and result in an error.

```json
{
  "private": false,
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "husky install",
    "prepublish": "pinst --disable",
    "postpublish": "pinst --enable"
  }
}
```

**Note for Yarn 2 users** `postinstall` won't run automatically, please run `yarn run postinstall` manually to enable hooks.

### Add a hook

```shell
npx husky add pre-commit "npm test"
# Creates .husky/pre-commit file
```

```shell
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
```

If `npm test` command fails, your commit will be automatically aborted.

## Migrate

To automatically migrate hooks defined with husky `v1..v4`, run the following command:

```shell
npm install husky@next -D && npx github:typicode/husky-migrate
```

## Recipes

### Monorepo

It's recommended to add husky in root `package.json`. You can use tools like [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and filters to only run scripts in packages that have been changed.

### Subdirectory

By design, `husky install` must be run in the same directory as `.git` but you can indicate where your git hooks are.

For example, if your `package.json` is in a subdirectory (.e.g `front/`), you can change directory during `postinstall` and specify where your git hooks are:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "cd .. && husky install ./front"
  }
}
```

### Bypass hooks

You can bypass `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks using Git `-n/--no-verify` option:

```shell
git commit -m "yolo!" --no-verify
```

For Git commands that don't have a `--no-verify` option, you can use `HUSKY` environment variable:

```shell
HUSKY=0 git push # yolo!
```

### Disable hooks in CI

You can set `HUSKY` environment variable to `0` in your CI config file, to disable all hooks.

Alternatively, most Continuous Integration Servers set a `CI` environment variable. You can use it in your hooks to detect if it's running in a CI.

```shell
[ -z "$CI" ] && exit 0
```

You can also use `is-ci` in your `postinstall` script to conditionnally install husky

```shell
npm install is-ci --save-dev
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "is-ci || husky install"
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### Does it work on Windows?

Yes. When you install Git on Windows, it comes with the necessary software to run shell scripts.

## Troubleshoot

### Command not found

If you're running Git from an app and the command can be found in your terminal, this means that the `PATH` in your app is different from your terminal.

You can `echo $PATH` in your terminal and configure your app to use the same value.

If you've installed your command using `brew`, see the [FAQ](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ) to make your command available to your app.

Finally, if you're using a script for managing versions like `nvm`, `n`, `rbenv`, `pyenv`, ... you can use `~/.huskyrc` to load the necessary before running hooks.

For example, for `nvm` that would be:

```shell
# ~/.huskyrc
# this loads nvm.sh and sets the correct PATH before running hook
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

### Hooks not running

Ensure that you don't have a typo in your filename. For example, `precommit` or `pre-commit.sh` are invalid names. See Git hooks [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) for valid names.

Check hooks permissions, they should be executable. This is automatically set when using `husky add` command but you can run `chmod +x <filename>` to fix that.

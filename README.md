You're viewing documentation for husky v5, which is free to use in Open Source projects ❤️ and in early access for Sponsors 🎁.

To use this new version at work, you can become a sponsor on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/typicode) or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/husky) (monthly or yearly donations are supported).

If you can't sponsor Husky, that's okay, [husky v4](https://github.com/typicode/husky/tree/master) is free to use in any project. During the early access, v4 will continue to receive maintainance updates.

After the early access, husky v5 will be MIT again.

## Install

```sh
npm install husky --save-dev
```

```js
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test",
      "pre-push": "npm test",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
git commit -m 'Keep calm and commit'
```

To go further, see the docs [here](https://github.com/typicode/husky/blob/master/DOCS.md).

## Uninstall

```sh
npm uninstall husky
```

## Upgrading from 0.14

If you're upgrading from `0.14`, simply move your hooks to `husky.hooks` field:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-   "precommit": "npm test",
-   "commitmsg": "commitlint -E GIT_PARAMS"
  },
+ "husky": {
+   "hooks": {
+     "pre-commit": "npm test",
+     "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
+   }
+ }
}
```

Or run the following command which will do the same automatically for you ;)

```
./node_modules/.bin/husky-upgrade
```

Alternatively, you can also use any of the files/formats that are supported by [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig). This means that you can place your husky hooks config in a `.huskyrc` file or export them from a `husky.config.js` file as well. Cosmiconfig supports `.js`, `.json`, and `.yaml` file formats.
